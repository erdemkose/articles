I started programming with [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) in 8th grade. Pascal was a very good starting point back then. I quickly learned the basics of programming and created my first game. It was a snake game running on the console like we had on Nokia phones. Unfortunately, I could not find the source code or any screenshot of my game üôÅ

My game development adventure ended when I met with web development in 1999. As I remember those were the days that Perl was dominating the web application domain. [PHP wasn‚Äôt running on Zend engine](https://www.php.net/manual/en/history.php.php#history.php4) and [Javascript was just 4 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_ref-press_release_2-1).

[Internet access was very limited in Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Turkey) and it was almost impossible to find Turkish resources about programming. That‚Äôs why I wanted to share my little knowledge about Perl with my Turkish fellows. But there was a problem. I didn‚Äôt have a credit card to buy a domain name or pay for the hosting. I found a free hosting service that gave a small disk space and created [my first website (](https://web.archive.org/web/20010307222824/http://erdemkose.azit.com:80/)[erdemkose.azit.com](http://erdemkose.azit.com)[)](https://web.archive.org/web/20010307222824/http://erdemkose.azit.com:80/) titled ‚Äú**CGI with Perl**‚Äù in 1999. It is still online thanks to [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/). I would like to thank them for providing this excellent service.

I remember checking my visitor counter at the bottom of the page every day. That was the only free way to measure visitor engagement. It was 6 years before Google launched Analytics.
