Iâ€™m moving to Berlin this month and I see this as a good opportunity to make new career choices. Berlin is a great city for a software developer. There are many international companies and lots of start-ups. If you need to find a job in Berlin, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) and [Indeed](https://de.indeed.com/) are great sites to look for job listings. Also, you can use [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) to learn more about the companies and salaries.
