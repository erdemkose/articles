Do you remember the times when Cloudflare was just an easy-to-set-up CDN? With the launch of Cloudflare Registrar, the only missing feature in Cloudflare is hosting.

With the new service, you can register the domain name you already added to Cloudflare. Cloudflare promises that they will only charge for the registry cost, nothing else. This means a domain name could cost only a couple of dollars.

You need to log in to your Cloudflare account and add as many domains as you can. After that, you must claim your place in line.
